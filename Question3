 Difference between window, screen and document in javascript.
 
 Window is the main JavaScript object root, i.e the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.

window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible  document object model/DOM.
